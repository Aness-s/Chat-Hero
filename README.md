# Chat-Hero
Group Project created for UofTHacks Hackathon 2021
This project is a chrome extension that includes an online chat web app for friends to chat and connect with each other. The main vision for this project was for it to be used to chat with friends while playing online board games but it certainly can be used to chat while on any other site.
